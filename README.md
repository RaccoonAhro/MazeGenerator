# MazeGenerator

Introduction

Just a simple maze generator in Python. I wanted to try using what I've been learning about in Python to make something.. somewhat useful.
It is by no means optimized and every Pythong expert would probably look at it in horror but I made it myself and I'm proud of that. :)


Screenshots

If you want to save the mazes generated you need to make a separate folder in the same directory as the .py, call it "screenshots" and uncomment the lines 214-220.
