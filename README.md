# MazeGenerator

Introduction

Just a simple maze generator in Python. I wanted to try using what I've been learning about in Python to make something.. somewhat useful.
It is by no means optimized and every Python expert would probably look at it in horror but I made it myself and I'm proud of that. :)

Requirements

You do need pygame for the visualisation. Since I'm not familiar with the different versions I won't give you a specific version but at the time of making I was using pygame 2.5.0 so if it doesn't work, try using that one.

Screenshots

If you want to save the mazes generated you need to make a separate folder in the same directory as the .py, call it "screenshots" and uncomment the lines 214-220.
